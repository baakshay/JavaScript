// and height in meter).

// 2. Calculate both their BMIs using the formula (you can even implement both
// versions)
// 3. Create a Boolean variable 'markHigherBMI' containing information about
// whether Mark has a higher BMI than John.
// Test data:
// ¬ß Data 1: Marks weights 78 kg and is 1.69 m tall. John weights 92 kg and is 1.95
// m tall.
// ¬ß Data 2: Marks weights 95 kg and is 1.88 m tall. John weights 85 kg and is 1.76

//25. Coding Challenge #3
/*
There are two gymnastics teams, Dolphins and Koalas. They compete against each other 3 times.
The winner with the highest average score wins the a trophy!

1. Calculate the average score for each team, using the test data below
2. Compare the team's average scores to determine the winner of the competition,
and print it to the console. Don't forget that there can be a draw, so test for 
that as well (draw means they have the same average score).

3. BONUS 1: Include a requirement for a minimum score of 100.
With this rule, a team only wins if it has a higher score than the other team, 
and the same time a score of at least 100 points. HINT: Use a logical operator to 
test for minimum score, as well as multiple else-if blocks üòâ

4. BONUS 2: Minimum score also applies to a draw! So a draw only happens when both 
teams have the same score and both have a score greater or equal 100 points. 
Otherwise, no team wins the trophy.

TEST DATA: Dolphins score 96, 108 and 89. Koalas score 88, 91 and 110
TEST DATA BONUS 1: Dolphins score 97, 112 and 101. Koalas score 109, 95 and 123
TEST DATA BONUS 2: Dolphins score 97, 112 and 101. Koalas score 109, 95 and 106

// Lecture 27. Statements and Expressions

// Ex:  3 +4 is an expression that produces a value and even 1992 is an expression 
//even though it is just a simple value or even ( true && false && !false ) all of
// this is an expression because, in the end, it produces a boolean value.

// Statements :  statement is a bigger piece of code that is executed and which does
// not produce a value on it self and we can compare it with normal spoken language.


//28. The Conditional (Ternary) Operator
//The concept of an operator like (ternary etc) and expression will produce value.
//The ternary operator is used to take quick decision

// means if we have a value we can asign that value to a variable so with this
// we can make Ternary operator really usefull to conditionally declare variables
// for example

Steven wants to build a very simple tip calculator for whenever he goes eating in a 
resturant. In his country, it's usual to tip 15% if the bill value is between 50 and 
300. If the value is different, the tip is 20%.

1. Your task is to caluclate the tip, depending on the bill value. Create a variable 
called 'tip' for this. It's not allowed to use an if/else statement üòÖ 
(If it's easier for you, you can start with an if/else statement, and then try to 
convert it to a ternary operator!)

2. Print a string to the console containing the bill value, the tip, and the final 
value (bill + tip). Example: 'The bill was 275, the tip was 41.25, and the total value 
316.25'

TEST DATA: Test for bill values 275, 40 and 430

HINT: To calculate 20% of a value, simply multiply it by 20/100 = 0.2
HINT: Value X is between 50 and 300, if it's >= 50 && <= 300 üòâ

GOOD LUCK üòÄ
